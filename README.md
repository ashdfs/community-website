## USQITSN Community Website

### Who are we:
USQ IT Students' Network exists to encourage **Community, Connections** and **Collaboration** among USQ IT students and the broader IT community. The [USQITSN Website](https://usqitsn.org) is our primary platform for initiatives of the student club. It houses our membership sign-up and other member related content.

Since the website is a community initiative, it should be created by members, for members. Thus, we have made it open-source so that it can be improved upon by all members.

In addition to the normal site content, we are planning on holding competitions for the creation of specific content for the website. The first such competition will be for members to create their own unique homepage for the site. The winner of the competition will have their homepage design featured as the USQITSN homepage, and the overall design flow through the rest of the website.

### How to contribute:
We would love as many of our members to contribute to the website as possible. Whether it is creating new content, fixing bugs or providing graphic design, each contribution will help make the site better place for our members.
If you are going to do any major work on the code base you will need to set up a LAMP stack. I would suggest reading the [tutorial](https://usqitsn.org/member-contributions/know-and-tell/creating-a-user-registration-form.php) on how the registration script works as it goes through the environment setup.
GitHub can also be a little confusing for beginners, so try reading this [beginners guide to contributing](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project)

* Fork the project & clone locally.
* Create an upstream remote and sync your local copy before you branch.
* Branch for each separate piece of work.
* Do the work, write good commit messages.
* Push to your origin repository.
* Create a new Pull Request in GitHub.
* Respond to any code review feedback

If you need more help, try asking on our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/USQITSN) or email [enquiries@usqitsn.org](mailto:enquiries@usqitsn.org)
